# Dataset information
Data Source: [Polaris](https://cdafound.org/polaris/)

# Project Objective
The objective of the project was to view the effect of viral hepatitis all over the world and how WHO plans to eliminate the disease from the world through proper and timely vaccination.

## Understand Business Objectives and User Requirements
We tried to understand the specific requirements and objectives. We identified key areas we want to focus on and the questions the business needs answers to.

## Define Business Questions and Metrics
We defined specific business questions that the dashboard should answer. Example questions include:
- What is the total population?
- What percentage of the total population has been treated?
- What is the population to death ratio?
- What's the number of prevalent cases?
- How many countries were represented in this analysis?

## Define the metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that will help answer the business questions. 
Example metrics include:
- Death Rate
- Birth Dose Coverage
- HBIG Coverage
- Percentage of Population Treated

## Preprocess the dataset
The dataset was cleaned by removing duplicates, correcting any inconsistencies, and ensuring the data was in a suitable format for analysis and visualization.

## Data modeling and relationships.
Dimensions with which to break down the analysis were identified. Hence, new tables for specified dimensions were created. These included:
- Indicators Table
- Countries Table
- Indicator Summary Table
- Summary Table
- Additional features were created to give more robustness to our analysis
The data model was designed using the Star Schema where the different dimensions were connected to the Facts table in a one-to-many relationship.

## Create visualizations and charts:
Appropriate chart types (e.g., bar charts, line charts, pie charts) were used to represent the metrics and insights. Interactive features such as filters, drill-down options, and tooltips were used for detailed information.

## Insights
- Countries continue to lag in terms of reaching relative or absolute Impact and Programmatic Targets by 2030 across all variables.
- More progress has been seen in tackling Hepatitis C. However, 3-dose vaccination coverage (Hepatitis B) has seen the most progress.

## Recommendation
- Countries should ramp up health-care programs to meet the aim by 2030.

## Deployment and Documentation
Once the dashboard was finalized, it was deployed to Power BI service. The project process and deliverables are documented here on GitHub.
